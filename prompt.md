Step 1: Set Up Whisper for Speech-to-Text Transcription
Objective:
Integrate Whisper (OpenAI's Speech-to-Text model) to transcribe recorded audio into text.

Instructions:
Install the Whisper model using Python:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai-whisper
Download the Whisper model (you can use the small, medium, or base model depending on the accuracy and performance needs):

python
Copy code
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("small") "
Record  containing the user activity descriptions.

Use Whisper to transcribe the audio into text:

python
Copy code
result = model.transcribe("your_audio.wav")
transcribed_text = result["text"]
print(transcribed_text)
Consider adding error handling in case of poor audio quality or unclear speech (e.g., if the model is unable to transcribe the speech properly, retry or handle gracefully).

Example of Input/Output:
Input: A recorded audio file (e.g., audio.wav) containing user activity descriptions.

Output: Transcribed text:

arduinoCopy code
"I attended a meeting from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM, did a project from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and talked with Ashwin from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM."
Step 2: Set Up OpenAPI (OpenAI GPT) to Process Transcribed Text
Objective:
Use OpenAI's GPT (e.g., GPT-4) to process the transcribed text and extract relevant data based on the provided template.

Instructions:
Set up the OpenAI API:

Sign up for OpenAI and get your API key.
Install the OpenAI Python package:
bash
Copy code
pip install openai
Define a prompt for the model that clearly extracts Date, Day, Start Time, End Time, Time Elapsed, and Task from the transcribed text.

Example Prompt to extract the necessary details from the transcribed text:

text
Copy code
"The following is a transcription of daily activities. Extract the data in the following format:

Date: [MM-DD-YY]  
Day: [Day of the week]  
Start Time: [HH:MM AM/PM]  
End Time: [HH:MM AM/PM]  
Time Elapsed: [X hrs]  
Task: [Task Description]

Transcription: 'I attended a meeting from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM, did a project from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and talked with Ashwin from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.'

Expected output:

Date: 15-03-25  
Day: Saturday  
Start Time: 6:00 AM  
End Time: 8:00 AM  
Time Elapsed: 2 hrs  
Task: Attended the meeting

Date: 16-03-25  
Day: Sunday  
Start Time: 9:00 AM  
End Time: 12:00 PM  
Time Elapsed: 3 hrs  
Task: Did a project

Date: 16-03-25  
Day: Sunday  
Start Time: 1:00 PM  
End Time: 2:00 PM  
Time Elapsed: 1 hr  
Task: Talked with Ashwin"
Send the transcription text to the OpenAI API for processing:

python
Copy code
import openai

openai.api_key = "your_api_key"

prompt = """The following is a transcription of daily activities. Extract the data in the following format:

Date: [MM-DD-YY]
Day: [Day of the week]
Start Time: [HH:MM AM/PM]
End Time: [HH:MM AM/PM]
Time Elapsed: [X hrs]
Task: [Task Description]

Transcription: 'I attended a meeting from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM, did a project from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and talked with Ashwin from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.'
"""

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=150
)

print(response["choices"][0]["text"].strip())
Step 3: Calculate Time Elapsed
Objective:
Calculate the time elapsed between Start Time and End Time in hours and minutes. Handle edge cases such as AM/PM times and potential multi-hour differences.

Instructions:
After extracting Start Time and End Time, calculate the time difference in hours and minutes.

For example, handle if there is a difference of minutes (e.g., 10 minutes = 0.17 hrs) or hours.

Consider handling edge cases like overlapping times or activities spanning across different days.

Example code:

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_time_elapsed(start_time_str, end_time_str):
    time_format = "%I:%M %p"
    start_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, time_format)
    end_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, time_format)
    
    # Handle time span across midnight
    if end_time < start_time:
        end_time += timedelta(days=1)
    
    # Calculate difference
    time_diff = end_time - start_time
    total_minutes = time_diff.total_seconds() / 60
    hours = total_minutes // 60
    minutes = total_minutes % 60
    return f"{int(hours)} hrs {int(minutes)} mins"

elapsed_time = calculate_time_elapsed("6:00 AM", "8:00 AM")
print(elapsed_time)
Step 4: Output Data in a Structured Format (Excel)
Objective:
Save the extracted and processed data into an Excel file in the specified template format.

Instructions:
Use Pandas to create a DataFrame from the extracted data:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas openpyxl
Write the DataFrame to an Excel file with the required columns: Date, Day, Start Time, End Time, Time Elapsed, and Task.

Example code to output data into Excel:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

data = [
    {"Date": "15-03-25", "Day": "Saturday", "Start Time": "6:00 AM", "End Time": "8:00 AM", "Time Elapsed": "2 hrs", "Task": "Attended the meeting"},
    {"Date": "16-03-25", "Day": "Sunday", "Start Time": "9:00 AM", "End Time": "12:00 PM", "Time Elapsed": "3 hrs", "Task": "Did a project"},
    {"Date": "16-03-25", "Day": "Sunday", "Start Time": "1:00 PM", "End Time": "2:00 PM", "Time Elapsed": "1 hr", "Task": "Talked with Ashwin"},
]

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_excel("tasks.xlsx", index=False)
Step 5: Review and Test the Code
Objective:
Test the complete workflow from audio recording to Excel file output.

Instructions:
Record and transcribe multiple example audio files to verify that the transcription process works accurately.
Verify that OpenAPI processing (extraction and time calculation) accurately handles varied activity descriptions and time formats.
Finally, verify that the generated Excel file has the correct data in the specified format, with accurate time calculations.
Step 6: Error Handling and Debugging
Objective:
Implement basic error handling and debugging measures to ensure the program runs smoothly in different scenarios.

Instructions:
Handle possible transcription errors (e.g., unclear speech or background noise) by adding retries or manual review.
Handle missing or misformatted data (e.g., incomplete start/end times) by flagging them for user review.
Provide logging functionality to trace any issues during transcription, extraction, or Excel writing.
Step 7: Optimize and Finalize
Objective:
Optimize the performance of the program and ensure the final code is clean, well-commented, and ready for deployment.

Instructions:
Refactor the code for efficiency (e.g., minimize API calls, improve extraction logic, etc.).
Add comments to the code to explain the key functions and steps.
Prepare the code for deployment in a production environment, ensuring that dependencies are properly handled.
